### Distributed system
It is a collection of independent computers interconnected via network.

### Distributed computing
Traditionally computing is performed on one machine i.e. we give one input computer processes it and gives corresponding output.
We experience this in our day to day life but if we want to handle large projects i.e. 3D graphics processing,sceintists data for which
single OS processing may not be enough.single computer may slow to solve the large problems(tasks) and therefore distributed computing 
comes into picture.Distributed conmputing takes place when we have large tasks then we chop that task into small units and distributed 
this work load over large number of computers so that every computer have smaller tasks to do and then combinding the results into one 
this will eventually increases the processing power.
for eg:-www i.e. world wide web,www has a lot of servers which contains the data of facebook,amazon,flipkart,gmail which are stored
in various number of servers over a single network.This is the example of distributed computing.

### Advantages of Distributed computing:-
#### 1)Scalibility and modular growth
Distributed system are scalables they work across different machines and scale horizontally.This means a user can add another machine to handle
the increasing workload instead of having to update a single system over and over again.

#### 2)Fault tolerance and Redundancy
Distributed system are also inherently more tolerant than single machines.A business running a cluster of 8 machines across
two data centers  means its app would work even if one data center goes offline.

#### 3)Low latency
Since users have a node in multiple geographical locations,distributed systems allow the traffic to hit a node thats closest,
it will result in low latency and better performance.

#### 4)Cost Effectiveness
Distributed system are much mnore cost effective compared to very large centralized systems.Their initial cost is higher than
centralized systems buta at the beginning after sometime it is cost effective.

#### 5)Efficiency
Distributed systems allow breaking complkex problems/data into smaller pieces and have multiple computers work on them in parallel,
which can help in cut down on the time needed to solve/computer those problems.
