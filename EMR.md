# EMR(ELASTIC MAP REDUCE)
Amazon EMR is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark, on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data.
By using these frameworks and related open-source projects, such as Apache Hive and Apache Pig, you can process data for analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads. 
Additionally, you can use Amazon EMR to transform and move large amounts of data into and out of other AWS data stores and databases,
such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon DynamoDB.

## ADVANTAGES:-
* Cost Savings
Amazon EMR pricing depends on the instance type and number of EC2 instances that you deploy and the region in which you launch your cluster.
* Integration
Amazon EMR integrates with other AWS services to provide capabilities and functionality related to networking, storage, security, and so on, for your cluster.
Amazon EC2 for the instances that comprise the nodes in the cluster.Amazon S3 to store input and output data. 
* Scalability and Flexibility
Amazon EMR provides flexibility to scale your cluster up or down as your computing needs change. 
* Reliability
Amazon EMR monitors nodes in your cluster and automatically terminates and replaces an instance in case of failure.
* Security
Amazon EMR leverages other AWS services, such as IAM and Amazon VPC, and features such as Amazon EC2 key pairs, to help you secure your clusters and data.
* Encryption
Amazon EMR supports optional Amazon S3 server-side and client-side encryption with EMRFS to help protect the data that you store in Amazon S3.
With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data after you upload it.
