# What is big data?
Big Data is a massive volume of both structured and unstructured data that is so large
it is difficult to process using traditional database and software techniques.
In most enterprise scenarios the volume of data is too big or it moves too fast or it exceeds current processing capacity.

# Industry use cases

### 1.Risk management
a)Suppliers now have the choice to share their production data with their partners and customers which creates 
complete transparency and a highly effective communication channel for both parties. This way the manufacturer can see 
exactly whether the supplier is delayed with production or just in time, to then adjust all the related processes and avoid waiting times.

b)Having supplier production and quality information available can also provide all data and insight needed for better risk management. 
Supplier dependencies are quantifiable and allow the manufacturer to make fact-based decisions when it comes to strategic risk management.

### 2.Build to order configurations
The build to order (BTO) production approach is a very efficient and profitable business model. But in order
to see real growth from it, a well-defined data platform needs to be in place to analyze customer behavior and sales data.
The manufacturer needs to have access to all sales data and be able
to make precise predictive analytics to foresee order volumes on each possible configuration and adjust their supply chain accordingly.

### 3.Improve product quality
Production line quality can also be significantly enhanced with big data analytics. 
Sensor data analysis can detect manufacturing defects early, which reduces the time
and cost related to adjusting the production processes.

### 4.After-sales
The costs of warranties and recalls can easily go out of control even due to the smallest mistakes
in the production process. With the help of big data, 
it is possible to either avoid or to foresee warranty or recall issues, potentially saving significant amounts of money.

### 5.Track daily production
In order to optimize production quality and yield, manufacturers need to have daily data flow
from their production lines in order to see discrepancies and opportunities in real-time. 

### 6.Data-driven enterprise growth
By using big data, it became possible to quickly 
compare the performance of different sites and also to pinpoint the reasons for the differences. 

### 7. Predictive and preventive maintenance
a)Thanks to the sophisticated sensor technology that is readily available nowadays, 
operational data can be collected and analyzed in real-time from almost any kind of machinery or consumer product.

b)When operational data is analyzed with a pattern recognition method, upcoming failures and need for maintenance
can be predicted well in advance.

### 8.Overhead tracking
The overhead costs are determining the profitability of each manufacturer. To have real control and 
visibility over these costs, big data environments are needed with connected data sources and advanced analytics capabilities.
