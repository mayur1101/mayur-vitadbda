# What is big data?
- The term big data came from computational science.Specially it is used to describe a scenario where the volume and the variety of the data overwhelm the existing tools to store and process it.
- In 2001 the industry analyst DOUGH LANEY described big data using the three Vâ€™s. (Volume , Velocity , Variety)

### Challenges
- Storage cost
- Filtering and finding relevant and valuable information in large quantity of data that often contains much information that is not valuable.
- The ability to analyse data quickly enough in order to maximize business value today and next just next quarter or next year.

#### Volume :
- It refers to the magnitude of the data that is being generated and collected.It is increasing at a faster rate from TB to PB.

#### Variety :
- It refers to different types of data that are being generated and captured.They extend beyond structured data and fall under the category of semi-structured and unstructured data.
- Structured data : The data that can be organized using a predefined data  model are known as structured data. (eg : RDBMS)
- Unstructured data : The data cannot be organized using pre defined data models. (eg : Video,Text,Audio)
- Semi-structured data : The data that fall between the category of structured and unstructured data. (Partial data model) (eg : XML,Web Pages)
Challenges :
- How to gather,link,match,clean and transform data across systems.
- How to connect and co relate data relationship and hierarchy in order to extract business value from data.

#### Velocity :
- It refers to the rate of generation of data. (eg : Data generated through mobile apps)
Challenges :
- Not reacting quickly enough to benefit from the data(eg : Data could be used to create a dashboard that could warn of a security breach or machine failure).

# Industry use cases

### 1.Risk management
a)Suppliers now have the choice to share their production data with their partners and customers which creates 
complete transparency and a highly effective communication channel for both parties. This way the manufacturer can see 
exactly whether the supplier is delayed with production or just in time, to then adjust all the related processes and avoid waiting times.

b)Having supplier production and quality information available can also provide all data and insight needed forr better risk management. 
Supplier dependencies are quantifiable and allow the manufacturer to make fact-based decisions when it comes to strategic risk management.

### 2.Build to order configurations
The build to order (BTO) production approach is a very efficient and profitable business model. But in order
to see real growth from it, a well-defined data platform needs to be in place to analyze customer behavior and sales data.
The manufacturer needs to have access to all sales data and be able
to make precise predictive analytics to foresee order volumes on each possible configuration and adjust their supply chain accordingly.

### 3.Improve product quality
Production line quality can also be significantly enhanced with big data analytics. 
Sensor data analysis can detect manufacturing defects early, which reduces the time
and cost related to adjusting the production processes.

### 4.After-sales
The costs of warranties and recalls can easily go out of control even due to the smallest mistakes
in the production process. With the help of big data, 
it is possible to either avoid or to foresee warranty or recall issues, potentially saving significant amounts of money.

### 5.Track daily production
In order to optimize production quality and yield, manufacturers need to have daily data flow
from their production lines in order to see discrepancies and opportunities in real-time. 

### 6.Data-driven enterprise growth
By using big data, it became possible to quickly 
compare the performance of different sites and also to pinpoint the reasons for the differences. 

### 7. Predictive and preventive maintenance
a)Thanks to the sophisticated sensor technology that is readily available nowadays, 
operational data can be collected and analyzed in real-time from almost any kind of machinery or consumer product.

b)When operational data is analyzed with a pattern recognition method, upcoming failures and need for maintenance
can be predicted well in advance.

### 8.Overhead tracking
The overhead costs are determining the profitability of each manufacturer. To have real control and 
visibility over these costs, big data environments are needed with connected data sources and advanced analytics capabilities.

# Big data challenges
There are two main chalenges associated with big data i.e.

1)How do we store or manage such a huge volume of data efficiently.

2)How do we process and extract valuable information from this huge huge volume of data within a given time frame.

# Solutions to big data problems
a)Hold workshops for employees to ensure big data adoptions.

b)Carefully select technology stack.

c)Mind costs and plan for future upscaling.

d)Remember that data isnt 100% accurate but still manage its quality.

e)Never neglect big data security.

# Hadoop Distribution and Vendors
The three hadoop distribution vendors are:-

### 1)CLOUDERA
Cloudera is the oldest vendor and it is widely used.It also has max number of clients.

### 2)MAPR
Mapr is the good open source with direct access NFS.

### 3)HORTONWORKS
Hortonworks is the free to use software & can be easily downloaded from website.

#### 10 Factors are essential for software hadoop distribution
1)License

2)Unique features

3)Community

4)Sql

5)Mapreduce

6)App Development

7)Replication mode

8)Architecture

9)Operating system

10)Free to use
